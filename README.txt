This software generates a background image based on which pokemon you have caught.

To use this software you must:
1. Be running a 64 bit version of Windows
2. Have Java 7 or greater installed

To run the software:
Click RUN_ME.bat
(or it may be possible to just click the PokemonGoWallpaperGenerator.jar file on some OS's)

Instructions:

2. Click 'Generate Background'

Note: If for some reason the software fails to change the background, then find the generated image in the 'wallpaper' folder and then manually set it as the background.
